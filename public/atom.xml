    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Vaccine use in public health is a victim of its own success, according to Claire Broome, M.D. Of Emory University.  Dr. Broome chaired a committee that looked at ways the U.S. could improve its National Vaccine Plan.  Vaccine coverage for children is at 90 percent in the U.S., said Broome, but in developing countries its much lower.  One example of a new vaccine is for pneumococcal pneumonia, which is being distribute to developing countries in Africa and southeast Asia with support from the Gates Foundation.</p>

<p>vaccines?
:28 The news is generally good.  Approximately 90 percent of children have received the routine childhood vaccines, which is a very good level of coverage.  And I think what&rsquo;s most exciting is that it has been possible to develop and distribute new vaccines over the last 20 years, which are effective against major childhood diseases that we have never had vaccines against in the past. So the system really has been able to use modern science to develop vaccines against childhood killers.</p>

<p>Compared to the rest of the world, our coverage is higher.  The real challenge is getting these new vaccines to children, for example, in developing countries who may not have the resources to have the benefit of these vaccines.</p>

<p>1:36 ex.
Maybe the best example is the disease called pneumococcal pneumonia.  And the new vaccine is called the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.  Now, pneumococcal pneumonia is the leading killer of young children in the developing world, in Africa, in India,  Southeast Asia.  And it basically can be substantially prevented by this pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.  So actually, the world is coming together behind funding from the Gates Foundation and from many countries to try to make this vaccine available in the developing world.</p>

<p>2:55 National Vaccine Plan?
I had the honor of charing a committee for the National Institute of Medicine, which looked at the draft plan and identified areas that were priorities. The plan had been developed by a number of different government agencies. We were taking a step back and looking at what were the most important issues that the plan should tackle. And I think that for the general population, the plan is important because vaccines are very complex entities, and it&rsquo;s really, takes a lot collaboration between the pharmaceutical companies that produce the vaccines, the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates them, the National Institutes of Health, which support the basic research, and the Centers for Disease Control, which actually help physicians get the vaccines to individuals. Now that sounds like a huge number of organizations that most people don&rsquo;t pay much attention to.</p>

<p>So what the plan tries to do is to facilitate coordination among those many, many organizations to be sure that the country has the vaccines that it needs, and also to assure that they are the safest vaccines that are possible.</p>

<p>The other huge area that the plan tackles is the importance of good communication. And I think that one of the issues with vaccines has been the misperceptions that surround some aspects of vaccines, in particular vaccine safety.</p>

<p>So the plan tries to encourage both better communication, on the part of government agencies, on the medical profession, but also an attempt to encourage people, parents particularly, to look for credible sources of information when they&rsquo;re making decisions for their children.</p>

<p>5:52 misconceptions
Well in fact, I would say the very biggest misconception is people think that their children are not at risk from the diseases that the vaccines protect against. We in public health are in some ways victims of our own success. We have 90 percent coverage with these very effective vaccines, so the diseases are pretty invisible.</p>

<p>However, as we&rsquo;ve seen with the whooping cough epidemic in California, the diseases are not gone. And when people choose not to vaccinate their children, the children are still at risk from diseases, which can kill the children. And I think that this is something that is relatively invisible to many parents. Of course they want to do what&rsquo;s best for their children. But they&rsquo;re just not aware that these diseases are not gone, they are just controlled by the very high levels of vaccination that we have in this country.</p>

<p>7:24 whooping cough?
Well the State of California and the Centers for Disease Control are very concerned.  And they have encouraged people, first of all, to be sure that their children are being vaccinated. And they also are encouraging physicians to be sure that children receive a booster dose, before they go into elementary school, and also at eleven to twelve years of age, so that their protection is maintained.</p>

<p>And the deaths have occurred in infants who, for the most part, are too young to vaccinate. So the only way to protect them is to stop the transmission of pertussis in the population. So that&rsquo;s why the recommendations focus maintaining an increasing vaccination levels in the general population.</p>

<p>8:27 pertussis?
It&rsquo;s actually a bacterium.  Scientific communication is always a challenge, and it&rsquo;s one of the problems with vaccines, that we need to really make an effort to communicate clearly, so that people understand what&rsquo;s happening.</p>

<p>9:31 safety?
I think that it&rsquo;s really important for people to look at the information that is available. And we actually have a number of systems to identify any possible safety effects from vaccines. First of all, any vaccine before it&rsquo;s licensed goes through what are called clinical trials, where there is a very careful evaluation of whether the vaccine works to prevent the disease, whether it&rsquo;s effective. But they also look very carefully to document its safety profile. So most vaccines will have been received by tens of thousands of individuals before they are licensed. So we do have a good handle on the safety before a vaccine is recommended for use in the general population. Once it is recommended for use, it&rsquo;s judged safe and effective, the government continues to have multiple systems to evaluate whether it is as safe as expected. And specifically, the systems try to look for rare or unusual or unexpected reactions that might have occurred due to the vaccine. And it&rsquo;s not easy to do, but in fact, there are a number of systems that are set up to continuously monitor the safety of vaccines. So I think in fact we do have quite a lot of information about vaccine safety.</p>

<p>There are then, if there is a concern, if there is a report of something that might be associated with a vaccine, then the system will go ahead an do a formal research study, because of course, many things happen to young children, because it&rsquo;s an age when children are developing and diseases first come to light. And since children are getting vaccinated at that age, someone might think that because they developed a seizure around the time they received a vaccine, someone might think that it was associated with the vaccine. So it&rsquo;s really important to look systematically to evaluate whether or not a particular adverse event, a safety issue, in fact is associated with the vaccine. So then the system goes into this sort of third phase of doing a research study.</p>

<p>13:15 flu.gov&hellip;.
That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s what I mean when I say that systems are readily available for individuals or for doctors to report a possible adverse event. But I think it&rsquo;s really important to emphasize that just because somebody thinks that it might be related to the vaccine does not prove that it&rsquo;s related to the vaccine.     So it&rsquo;s very important for people to be aware of that, to be able to report.  But it&rsquo;s also important for them to understand then, it&rsquo;s important that there be a systematic study to evaluate whether or not a possible link is real.</p>

<p>14:14 autism?
Yes, that certainly has been a very important issue. And I think it&rsquo;s important for people to understand the background. It appears that there has been an increase in autism spectrum disorders over the past twenty years. There&rsquo;s a lot of effort to try and define whether it&rsquo;s a real increase.  But there are many suggestions that there has been a real increase. And public health authorities think it is extremely important for there to be better understanding of what is going on with this apparent increase. There needs to be excellent scientific research to look at the causes and possible risk factors as to why there should be this increase. It&rsquo;s also very important that there is attention to early diagnosis and to looking at what can be done to help children with this disorder do as well as possible. And it&rsquo;s something that we take very seriously.</p>

<p>At one point, probably fifteen years ago now, there were allegations that the increase in autism spectrum disorder was related to vaccines.  And there have been several separate assertions of why that might be. So the Institute of Medicine, which is this formal body, independent and held to the highest standards of scientific evidence, was asked to look at the possible association between autism and vaccines, specifically – the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, or the preservative that was used in some vaccines, thimerosal.  They did a multi-year review where they looked at a number of scientific research studies, as I was mentioning  before, after an adverse event is alleged to be linked, the most important thing is to actually do a scientific study to try to evaluate rigorously whether it is or is not. So the Institute of Medicine looked at a body of research studies and came to the conclusion that there was not credible scientific evidence to support what they call a causal relationship between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism. Nor did they find any evidence to support a thimerosal and autism association.</p>

<p>So I think that it&rsquo;s a long answer to your question, but I think it&rsquo;s very important for people to recognize that there are a lot of assertions made in the media, but it&rsquo;s important to look at the credibility and the basis for those assertions, and to look at what an independent body has done to evaluate the question and conclude that there is not an association.</p>

<p>18:26 link to report
Also, I would recommend that your listeners look at the Centers for Disease Control website, because they also document studies that have been conducted after the Institute of Medicine review and continue to support its conclusions.</p>

<p>19:52 improve?
Well, we did think coordination is increasingly important activity. And it sounds very boring, but when you&rsquo;re trying to work with such a complex system, with so many parts, I think there is a real merit to having a systematic approach. For example, it is important to work together to define, what are the vaccines this country needs?  If we just let each researcher work on their favorite disease, we won&rsquo;t necessarily identify which diseases are still causing a substantial burden. And we won&rsquo;t coordinate all the different resources to develop vaccines to prevent those diseases. So that was one area that we identified that needed particular coordination among researchers, the NIH, and manufactures. We also felt that the issue of communication takes a lot of coordination, a strategic approach, a science-based approach, but also which considers, which are the issues that need to have a dialog about. So we wanted communication that really engaged parents, and understood their concerns, but also was able to provide the kind of information that would be helpful for them in making informed decisions about their children.</p>

<p>22:21 decisions?
Well I think everyone would love to have vaccines which are 100 percent safe. However, what I think I would go back to is the issue that the diseases are not safe.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s take for example, the measles vaccine, which basically 90 percent of the children in the U.S. get. Before there was a measles vaccine,  basically every child in the country got measles, because it&rsquo;s very transmissible. Two of 1,000 measles cases die. So this is not a benign disease. Lots of kids do just fine, but two of 1,000 die. Now the vaccine is very safe. But there probably is a frequency of one in a million children who get the vaccine who may have a severe allergic reaction. Would you say that we shouldn&rsquo;t have a measles vaccine, that two of 1,000 children getting measles should die because there could be one in a million chance of an adverse event from the vaccine? I think that&rsquo;s what people don&rsquo;t really see, is that there&rsquo;s continued effort to try to make the safest vaccines possible. But if you don&rsquo;t have a vaccine, then you have people getting a disease, which can be fatal.</p>

<p>25:15 complicated
I think the examples that you&rsquo;re giving are good ones.  But there really are two benefits from the vaccines. One is protecting the population at large and protecting people who cannot be vaccinated, such as young infants or persons with immune deficiencies.  But also, the vaccines protect the individual. And I&rsquo;ve given you the severity of something like measles, of Haemophilus (type) b meningitis.  These are not mild diseases. They kill children. So yes, there&rsquo;s certainly a role for informed decision making, and parents have many, many responsibilities for the care of their children. However, there&rsquo;s also a level of public health responsibility for protecting young children, which I think vaccines accomplish.</p>

<p>26:28 didn&rsquo;t ask?
I think that we&rsquo;ve covered a lot of the issues.  I&rsquo;m not sure people appreciate how successful vaccines have been.  I think about what happened with the Salk and Sabin polio vaccine, and how much the country was aware of that success and how afraid they were of polio epidemics.  But we have similar successes, for example, with the Haemophilus (type) b vaccine in the last 18 years, and it&rsquo;s relatively invisible. But I think, in fact I would hope people would appreciate that their children are no longer at risk of dying from Haemophilus influenza type b.</p>

<p>27:54  most important vaccines
I really want parents to appreciate that vaccines provide the opportunity to protect their children from truly deadly diseases.  The fact that we no longer have hospitals full of iron lungs, that pediatric residents today have not even seen Haemophilus meningitis, is something that is a true success story for parents, for physicians, and for those of us in public health.</p>
