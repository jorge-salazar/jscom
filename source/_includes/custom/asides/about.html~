<h2>about me</h2>
<p>I'm a media professional with over 12 years experience writing, editing, and producing science journalism for broadcast radio, television, and publication online. I love pushing the boundaries, and I'm learning to code as evidenced by this website which I built. </p>

        <p class="hiddenContentp">This is all of your hidden content. This will be invisible at first, but after clicking on the link above this will slide in.</p>
