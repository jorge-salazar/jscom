<h2>about me</h2>
<p>I'm a media professional with over 12 years experience writing, editing, and producing science journalism for broadcast radio, television, and publication online. For over a dozen years I've been a producer for the digital media company EarthSky.org, which got its start in 1991 with a grant from the National Science Foundation. With EarthSky I've interviewed hundreds of the world's top scientists and have had the priviledge to co-host an internationally syndicated radio series broadcast on over 1200 stations worldwide. I'm available now for freelance journalism work. My backround is in science, and I have a BA in physics from U.T. Austin. I love pushing the boundaries, and I'm learning to code as evidenced by this website which I built. </p>
